    <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>If you like a juicy streak. Sous Vide is the way to go. This way of preparing
        steak will make just about any steak tender. This reqiures a vacuum sealer and 
        a specific water heater. However if you have these at your disposal. You will
        not regret making a steak this way. <strong>WARNING</strong> undercooked food 
        can make you sick. 
      </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Steak</strong> - We prefer choice grade or higher. Ribeye or a similar style of steak.</li>
        <li><strong>Salt and Pepper</strong> - Good steaks don't need a lot of seasoning. Salt and pepper is all you need.</li>
        <li><strong>Butter,thyme and garlic</strong> - If you intend to finish your steak in an iron skillet you will need these ingredients.</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Vacuum seal your steak</li>
        <li>Set your water temperature 5 degrees lower than how you like your steak cooked. I like medium rare so I set my temperature to 125.</li>
        <li>I leave my steak in the water bath for 1.5 hours. Thicker steaks may take longer.</li>
        <li>Once an hour and a half has passed. Remove steak from vacuum bag and place on plate.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle salt and pepper on top of your steak.</li>
        <li>You can sear your steak however you like. My preferred method is a blow torch. You can use an iron skillet with butter, thyme and garlic. Or sear it on the grill.</li>
        <li>Once seared let steak rest for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Dig in and Enjoy!</li> </ol>
